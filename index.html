               <h1>August 18th</h1>
               <p>Marching band practice got cancelled today which is a shame. I was planning on being able to see my friends today but nope I guess I'll have to wait for next week. I think I might try to make a new website today but I don't really have any ideas, this website has been the best idea I've had so far. I have little to talk about today so I might just go code for a little bit now. See you tomorrow.</p>

                         <p>It appears I'm going to be doing my blog every other day now. I've been trying to learn java lately because I've been bored but idk how far I will get in it. Donkey kong country got released for the snes online service and now I'm happy to own snes online, one of the few games I wanted. I have to go to band practice tomorrow which will probably be fine because I get to see my friends. I'm going to go try and code something or practice something. bye</p>

                       <h1>August 15th</h1>
                       <p>Today I went to red lobster with my grandparents and then got some new shoes. Red lobster was really good. We went to the skechers store to get shoes and I got the most comfortable pair of tennis shoes ever. After that we went to lowes and my mom bought some flowers and it was awesome. In my car ride to red lobster my dad listened to both In the Aeroplane Over The Sea and On Avery Island. This week is going to be great because I have no school or anything, maybe I'll play more terraria. Also Diet coke is the worst drink to ever be invented, people who drink it are probably future serial killers. Anyways goodbye.</p>

                       <h1>August 13th</h1>
                       <p>They are closing school next week, people think that there won't be any school after that. I'm being forced to go tomorrow but I don't want to, I guess it will be good to finish before the end. I have been getting really into the band neutral milk hotel lately and I think it's been all I listen to now days. My favorite song is called "Song against sex" which is a real classic, another favorite of mine is king of carrot flowers part 3. The school gets more empty everyday, barely anyone on the bus anymore which means theres more seats now but man, it's kinda sad seeing so many people gone. I've been doing cringe on my tests in digital technology because they have so little questions, I have an average of 74.5% currently which isn't failing but I really want to get a 90 in that class later on. I think the reason I'm doing so poorly on tests in that class is because they are currently about things like masters degrees and career stuff. I think it's pretty lame so far. Also it looks like I have a lot of content today compared to other days, big win. I wish I could find another project to start working on soon but I have so little knowledge about programming that I don't think I could make anything interesting; maybe i'll make a website about my hobby's and interests. This might be all that I have going on lately so I guess it's goodbye for now. Goodbye.</p>

                        <h1>August 11th</h1>
                        <p>Today Was my first day back to school since being sick, it went decent. I finished all my work at school and did everything that I missed yesterday. Planning on trying out terraria hardmode today because I beat everything in my last playthrough. No one reads these blogs anymore sadly but I'm still making them for some reason, maybe I'll make a new project soon. I think I'm gonna go now. Bye everyone.</p>

                        <h1>August 9th</h1>
                        <p>Today I feel sick so I won't be going to school tomorrow, hopefully I feel better soon. Also I think I am addicted to terraria, I have around 60 hours and I don't plan on stopping now. I feel terrible lately because of being sick though, my body feels funky and my throat hurts. I hope I can make up any work that I'm missing tomorrow. Anyways tonight is going to be a short and sweet blog due to the fact that I don't feel so great, I'm suprised that I've managed to keep it updated this long. Farewell my friends and have a great week.</p>

                        <h1>August 7th</h1>
                        <p>Today is Friday which means the last day of the week, I actually survived the first week. Also, I have about 50 hours in terraria which means I'm a pro gamer now. I don't have much to talk about but I do know that school is nice, I enjoy going to it more so than middle school. I'm planning on whether or not I should learn how to solve a Rubik's cube again, I got really good at it and then stopped for a while. My Literature teacher has been absent for 4 days which sucks because I actually want to learn something, hopefully, he doesn't have COVID. For dinner I'm having hamburgers made by my mom, dinner will be win.</p>
