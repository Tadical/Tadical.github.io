                     <h1>January 4th</h1>
                     <p>It has been a while since I've talked to you. Christmas passed and I got a lot of great things, mainly video games. My favorite video game that I got for christmas is New super mario bros u deluxe because I can play it with other people. A week after christmas, I went on a youth trip with my church to a place called winter xtreme. It was very fun and I met a lot of cool and unique people, they also gave me a lot of spending money which I still have leftover of. I bought a razer deathadder mouse with the extra money the church gave me. Today I got a new desk for my laptop which means I have my own personal space to do things like homework if needed. Tomorrow is the first day of school after the break and I don't want to go but I know it will be fine. I got some new headphones during christmas that I can use in school.</p>

                    <h1>December 21st</h1>
                    <p>Only four more days until Christmas day. I'm really excited for Christmas because I get to see my grandparents and also get new presents. The main things I asked for are a new lamp and a bedside table because mine are kind of broken right now. I also asked for a lot of video games and stuff. I have no idea what I'm getting from the other grandparents because I didn't ask them for anything.</p>

                     <p>It's finally christmas break and I'm happy to be out of school. I haven't been doing a lot lately and just been playing video games. Might edit this blog later to say something interesting but nothings going on.</p>

                      <h1>November 28th</h1>
                      <p>This week has been pretty okay. It's been thanksgiving break which means doing nothing but playing video game and relaxing while eating turkey. It was fun but it seems I need to start reading my book before tuesday so that I don't fail literature. I've been playing a lot of tf2 lately which is fun, favorite character is spy even though I suck. That's all for now but I might release a new album review soon.</p>

                      <h1>November 21st</h1>
                      <p>I have been unquarantined and life is great now. I took three tests today in all my classes combined, I made a 100% on my math one on graphing linear functions and I failed the other two literature tests. Although I failed both tests I managed to keep my grade at a passing percentage with a 82%. I haven't been coding much since the beginning of quarantine due to an overall lack of motivation but I do plan on coding more often now that I am feeling better, also I still plan on going to college for computer science. I think the reason I'm doing so well in math is because they put me in a slower, less intelligent math class which covers topics that I have been learning since 7th grade. I think that is a mistake but I will do better in the harder classes if I relearn the basics. I also haven't been writing much on my music blog, I plan on listening to more albums soon perhaps over the thanksgiving break but I've been busy with school. In conclusion this week has been pretty good and I'm glad to be back in school. </p>
