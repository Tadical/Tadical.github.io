                     <h1>March 3rd</h1>
                     <p>I wish I had the same motivation for making and writing websites as I did during the summer, some of my passion has died due to external factors but the lack of blogs is mainly due to time. I still enjoy website building for the sole reason of self expression which is something that I highly value. I have big plans for the future of my computer science career and wish to attend a university so that I may gain further knowledge although it will take some time. Currently I wish that my schoolwork was more challenging, I easily make all A's in the classes that I'm skilled at. My favorite class is literature because reading is a newfound hobby of mine and literature emphasizes reading. Math is less interesting than it used to be due to my ability to grasp new concepts fairly quickly; I hope to get into advanced classes later on in life. I recently read George Orwells "1984" and I personally loved it, the world is beautifully crafted from start to finish and I never got tired of reading. Also on a different note I weigh 203 pounds now as opposed to the 226 that I was in the beginning. That should be it for now, heres hoping to more blogs and websites.</p>

                      <h1>February 6th 2021</h1>
                      <p>The last two weeks I have been on a weight loss journey, I've been walking 10k plus steps a week plus lifting weights and running. I've lost almost 15 pounds mostly due to water weight but now it is starting to become normal. I've also been dieting with a calorie deficit of around 1000 calories which in addition to the exercise is perfect for me. I have good grades in school still and I have been playing the drums more often because of my newfound energy. I started waking up at 6 am and going to bed around 8:30 pm to get a consistent sleep schedule. It's been good lately.</p>
