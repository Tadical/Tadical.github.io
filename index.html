                        <h1>July 30th</h1>
                        <p>Today I went to the farmers market with my grandma, It's her birthday and we went on an adventure. We got a ton of spicy goods and even some sweets! After that we ended up at this little restaurant that we've never been to before. Turns out the restaurant was amazing and worth a second visit, I got the burger. After that we went to a craft store and it was huge, yarn as far as the eye could see! It was a very long drive home (around 2 hours) but I'm finally here and updating this blog for you. About to eat giant pizza with my grandma for her birthday dinner. Goodbye!</p>

                        <h1>July 29th</h1>
                        <p>Today I went to open house because my old school finally had my records ready to send and I have a schedule now. My first period is computer science which is awesome because it is also my favorite class. The last period is band which I also love and everything in between is standard school stuff. Also yesterday the bunny ate my headphone wire and I'm still really upset about that. Maybe I'll get some new headphones soon but for now, I'm stuck with only one side working. We aren't required to use a locker at my new school and I'm allowed to just use a backpack which I'm excited about. I don't understand the schools that don't let you use your backpack, why make the kid pay for something that they only use twice all day. Anyways goodbye!</p>
