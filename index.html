                        <h1>August 2nd</h1>
                        <p>Today I went to a new church that I didn't hate. After that, I went home and beat the final boss of pre hardmode terraria and then went to lunch with my grandparents. When I got back home we got to play with the bunny and see it hop around everywhere and it was cute. I later realized that my terraria world had been turned into hard mode. Hardmode has been giving me pains and I regret defeating the wall of flesh. Anyways tomorrow is the first day of school and I'm nervous so I'll need to go to bed soon, bye.</p>

                        <h1>August 1st</h1>
                        <p>Today I woke up and then it was time to go to lunch, we ate red lobster. I rarely go to red lobster (around once every two years or more) it was cool to be able to go. Tomorrow is the last day of the summer. After that, I will be writing blogs about school and things related to school. Today I also played Terraria with my friends; it was fun. Haven't done much else today though so that will be it for today, hopefully, next week will be better for blogging.</p>

                        <h1>July 31st</h1>
                        <p>Today I woke up and then went right back to bed until about 1 pm. After that I played terraria for a while and then ate at my favorite sandwich shop, The sandwich was pretty good. To be honest I haven't been doing much today besides playing terraria, have around 29 hours in it now. Also, I have borrowed my dad's old beats wireless headphones which means music is real again. Thinking about changing the design of the website to be more modern or something because I understand that right now it looks pretty bland. Also in my computer science class, I will be learning java which may mean I will be doing less web stuff but I'm not sure what I can do with java, maybe I could make a cool Minecraft mod. Anyways goodbye and hopefully, I'll talk to you guys tomorrow.</p>

                        <h1>July 30th</h1>
                        <p>Today I went to the farmers market with my grandma, It's her birthday and we went on an adventure. We got a ton of spicy goods and even some sweets! After that we ended up at this little restaurant that we've never been to before. Turns out the restaurant was amazing and worth a second visit, I got the burger. After that we went to a craft store and it was huge, yarn as far as the eye could see! It was a very long drive home (around 2 hours) but I'm finally here and updating this blog for you. About to eat giant pizza with my grandma for her birthday dinner. Goodbye!</p>

                        <h1>July 29th</h1>
                        <p>Today I went to open house because my old school finally had my records ready to send and I have a schedule now. My first period is computer science which is awesome because it is also my favorite class. The last period is band which I also love and everything in between is standard school stuff. Also yesterday the bunny ate my headphone wire and I'm still really upset about that. Maybe I'll get some new headphones soon but for now, I'm stuck with only one side working. We aren't required to use a locker at my new school and I'm allowed to just use a backpack which I'm excited about. I don't understand the schools that don't let you use your backpack, why make the kid pay for something that they only use twice all day. Anyways goodbye!</p>
