                         <h1>June 8th</h1>
                         <p>It's finally summer and I have to say that I ended school in quite a fantastic way. In short, I ended 9th grade with decent grades and a girlfriend. The girls name is Kyleigh and she's been my best friend since the beginning of 9th grade when I met her at band camp, she introduced me to a lot of her friends at the beginning of the year which helped me out a ton when I had just moved and knew nobody. She makes me feel incredibly special and I'm proud to have her as my girlfriend as well as my bestfriend, I have a feeling the relationship will last a long time because it's currently being built on a foundation of trust and mutual respect for each other.
                         <br><br>The good grades aren't all that important compared to Kyleigh but it was nice to exempt finals because I got to go on a field trip with her.</p>

                         <h1>April 16th</h1>
                         <p>This weekend I'm spending the night at my grandmothers. I'm having a decent amount of fun so far because I brought my computer which means I can program easily. Learning python is going really well and I'm on chapter 10 now, I have learned a lot and I think using a book to learn is great. My interests in computers are at an all time high mainly due to using linux and surrounding myself with people who enjoy technology as much as I do. I think I should make a seperate website just for talking about computers, it would be nice to have a certain topic to always talk about instead of just doing whatever.</p>

                        <h1>April 10th</h1>
                        <p>I got a Python book called "Python Crash Course 2nd edition" and it's working really great for me. I am learning more about Python than I was when I watched youtube tutorials and it's helping me develop a better undering of Python and programming in general. I have moved away from Manjaro and decided to stick with Kubuntu for as long as possible. The main reason I chose Kubuntu was because it used the kde desktop interface which I enjoy using a lot. It's also more stable which is great for me because I don't feel like fixing a broken system every 4 minutes.</p>

                         <h1>March 25th</h1>
                         <p>Yesterday I decided that I will learn faster if I stick to one linux distro. I have decided on sticking to ubuntu because of it's stability and ease of use, I don't plan on moving away from it for a while. Today I'm getting new stickers for my computer and they will be the ubuntu logo and the Linux tux mascot. I think today is two weeks since I started using it, I loved it immediately. Anyways, I have also started the process of becoming more private and secure online because it will help me in the future.</p>

                      <h1>March 23rd</h1>
                      <p>Today is the first day that I've really gotten into programming again, I am finally making websites again and I don't really understand why I didn't do it before. I have been feeling some laziness catching up to me but I think I deserve a break. My friends wonder why I am so quiet and so reserved, the truth is that I'm scared of getting close to people in fear that I will have to leave them again like I did in 2019 and 2020 (long story). Anyways I can't promise frequent blog posts but I will try my hardest to improve as a programmer and Computer Science student.</p>
