                     <h1>September 30th, my Birthday.</h1>
                     <p>TODAY WAS SO AWESOME. It was my birthday today and the first thing I did was wake up at like 6 am and watch poltergeist, an incredible movie. Around 9:30 or so we went to the donut shop and got some donuts to eat on our way to the DMV. I turned 15 this year so I had to take my learner's license test, I passed it thankfully which determined the quality of my day and week. After that, we went to Target and I didn't think my mom would buy me anything because I already got a computer earlier in the year for programming but she bought me the most awesome pair of noise-canceling wireless headphones. The headphones are great and one of the best pairs I've ever owned. After that, we went to one of my favorite restaurants and it was great. Meanwhile one of my best friends gave me a $20 Nintendo gift card, very nice of him! I bought Okami HD and sonic 2 with the money, both of which are great games. After we got back home I was able to drive a little bit to get the feel of it. Driving is really hard. Anyways that is about all I did on my birthday today. Bye!</p>

                     <p>Hi guys, only two more days until my birthday. This week is fall break which I am excited for because no school. I just beat mario galaxy which is my first time beating it. I have to take a license test wednesday which I am slightly nervous for. Anyways today I don't have much to say. Goodbye.</p>

                        <p>My teacher graded my science test wrong, I actually got a 100% on it which is awesome sauce, it also made my grade become a 99%. Also I hope I get to learn something with programming soon. Also I really like math because it is awesome. Math is getting harder though which is fine because I sorta like being more challenged. Language arts is the worst subject ever, and not just because I'm failing it. Anyways I've been real busy with school so i need to go now. Bye.</p>

                      <h1>September 22nd</h1>
                      <p>School is getting stressful. I have a failing grade in literature and a test in health tomorrow, wish me luck. I have been playing chess a lot lately and I'm finally good enough to beat all of my friends, I think it's one of my new hobbies and I feel smart when playing it. I hope I can pull up my grade in literature before the end of the semester. Anyways my brain is dead tonight so good night.</p>

                      <h1>September 19th</h1>
                      <p>Ah, a new week to write my thoughts and experiences on. I'm hoping that people still frequent this blog because if not, I'd have no good reason to keep writing. Today I taught my dad how to play chess which was a fun and frustrating experience at the same time, It's always challenging to teach someone something new. Speaking of chess, I'm improving greatly at it. I finally understand the game to an extent and I can beat my friends. I like chess because it allows me to think. In my opinion, the ability to think is taken for granted. My grade in science could be better, yesterday I went from a 98% to a 90% which was due to the exam that I scored an 88% on that day, maybe next time I'll study for longer.</p>
