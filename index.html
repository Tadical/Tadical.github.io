                       <h1>November 7th</h1>
                       <p>It has been a real long time since I last made a blog. I've been busy with school work and also playing video games. The school has made me quarantine until the 17th of November which means once I go back to school I will have around 3 days until Thanksgiving break with is cool. I haven't been bored while in quarantine though, I've been watching a lot of jojos bizarre adventure and trying out a ton of new steam games! I may sound like a grumpy teenager but I kinda like being home all day not having to do anything, It feels freeing. My teachers don't assign anything which kind of sucks because they will probably expect me to have a ton of work done by the 17th. Not sure If I have mentioned my headphones yet but they are awesome, It is definitely the best pair I've owned so far. Anyways today was kind of a short blog but I wanted to give some updates around my life although no one reads this blog besides my mom and dad.</p>

                     <p>My primary focus has been shifted to my music blog. I will still update occasionally but not as much. Sorry for the inconvenience.</p>

                      <p>MAN, It's been a really long time since I made a blog. I really should of been making more this week but school work is really tough so I've been focusing on that more and more. Life has been pretty good except for yesterday when I got over stimmulated at the football game and got really upset and had an anxiety attack or two, being tired didn't help either. Today I got to sleep in which was nice but tomorrow I have to wake up for church which is alright I guess. Feeling more sensitive In the way I react to things lately, maybe there's have something wrong with me. I mean there probably is something wrong with me I can just feel it, can't pinpoint what is wrong with me but I know theres something going on in my brain. Always been that way. Well this blog is sad now so I guess I'll go. Bye :)</p>

                      <h1>October 10th</h1>
                      <p>Well there is no more standing on the bus. They fixed the issue easily within 3 days and managed to get the other kids a separate bus! I haven't been coding as much as I should lately, school is stressful and I think homework is more important right now. I really wish I had a programming class, I want something exciting to do such as learn any programming language in school. Today I went to one of my favorite restaurants today and ate way more than I should of, I'm still full from it too... I also got some new crocs and mario themed pins! I'm gonna go now but maybe I'll make a new blog soon.</p>

                      <p>Today I had to stand on the bus... It was awful. The whole bus was packed full and there was no where at all to sit. I think some of the distanced learners came back to school finally which is gonna suck because I was fine without them. I love my school especially math because of my teacher. Anyways I'ma go do something else now. Bye :)</p>
