                 <p>It has been a while since I've talked to you. Christmas passed and I got a lot of great things, mainly video games. My favorite video game that I got for christmas is New super mario bros u deluxe because I can play it with other people. A week after christmas, I went on a youth trip with my church to a place called winter xtreme. It was very fun and I met a lot of cool and unique people, they also gave me a lot of spending money which I still have leftover of. I bought a razer deathadder mouse with the extra money the church gave me. Today I got a new desk for my laptop which means I have my own personal space to do things like homework if needed. Tomorrow is the first day of school after the break and I don't want to go but I know it will be fine. I got some new headphones during christmas that I can use in school.</p>

                <p>Only four more days until Christmas day. I'm really excited for Christmas because I get to see my grandparents and also get new presents. The main things I asked for are a new lamp and a bedside table because mine are kind of broken right now. I also asked for a lot of video games and stuff. I have no idea what I'm getting from the other grandparents because I didn't ask them for anything.</p>

                  <p>This week has been pretty okay. It's been thanksgiving break which means doing nothing but playing video game and relaxing while eating turkey. It was fun but it seems I need to start reading my book before tuesday so that I don't fail literature. I've been playing a lot of tf2 lately which is fun, favorite character is spy even though I suck. That's all for now but I might release a new album review soon.</p>

                  <h1>November 21st</h1>
                  <p>I have been unquarantined and life is great now. I took three tests today in all my classes combined, I made a 100% on my math one on graphing linear functions and I failed the other two literature tests. Although I failed both tests I managed to keep my grade at a passing percentage with a 82%. I haven't been coding much since the beginning of quarantine due to an overall lack of motivation but I do plan on coding more often now that I am feeling better, also I still plan on going to college for computer science. I think the reason I'm doing so well in math is because they put me in a slower, less intelligent math class which covers topics that I have been learning since 7th grade. I think that is a mistake but I will do better in the harder classes if I relearn the basics. I also haven't been writing much on my music blog, I plan on listening to more albums soon perhaps over the thanksgiving break but I've been busy with school. In conclusion this week has been pretty good and I'm glad to be back in school. </p>

                    <p>It has been a real long time since I last made a blog. I've been busy with school work and also playing video games. The school has made me quarantine until the 17th of November which means once I go back to school I will have around 3 days until Thanksgiving break with is cool. I haven't been bored while in quarantine though, I've been watching a lot of jojos bizarre adventure and trying out a ton of new steam games! I may sound like a grumpy teenager but I kinda like being home all day not having to do anything, It feels freeing. My teachers don't assign anything which kind of sucks because they will probably expect me to have a ton of work done by the 17th. Not sure If I have mentioned my headphones yet but they are awesome, It is definitely the best pair I've owned so far. Anyways today was kind of a short blog but I wanted to give some updates around my life although no one reads this blog besides my mom and dad.</p>

                   <p>MAN, It's been a really long time since I made a blog. I really should of been making more this week but school work is really tough so I've been focusing on that more and more. Life has been pretty good except for yesterday when I got over stimmulated at the football game and got really upset and had an anxiety attack or two, being tired didn't help either. Today I got to sleep in which was nice but tomorrow I have to wake up for church which is alright I guess. Feeling more sensitive In the way I react to things lately, maybe there's have something wrong with me. I mean there probably is something wrong with me I can just feel it, can't pinpoint what is wrong with me but I know theres something going on in my brain. Always been that way. Well this blog is sad now so I guess I'll go. Bye :)</p>

                   <p>Well there is no more standing on the bus. They fixed the issue easily within 3 days and managed to get the other kids a separate bus! I haven't been coding as much as I should lately, school is stressful and I think homework is more important right now. I really wish I had a programming class, I want something exciting to do such as learn any programming language in school. Today I went to one of my favorite restaurants today and ate way more than I should of, I'm still full from it too... I also got some new crocs and mario themed pins! I'm gonna go now but maybe I'll make a new blog soon.</p>

                 <p>TODAY WAS SO AWESOME. It was my birthday today and the first thing I did was wake up at like 6 am and watch poltergeist, an incredible movie. Around 9:30 or so we went to the donut shop and got some donuts to eat on our way to the DMV. I turned 15 this year so I had to take my learner's license test, I passed it thankfully which determined the quality of my day and week. After that, we went to Target and I didn't think my mom would buy me anything because I already got a computer earlier in the year for programming but she bought me the most awesome pair of noise-canceling wireless headphones. The headphones are great and one of the best pairs I've ever owned. After that, we went to one of my favorite restaurants and it was great. Meanwhile one of my best friends gave me a $20 Nintendo gift card, very nice of him! I bought Okami HD and sonic 2 with the money, both of which are great games. After we got back home I was able to drive a little bit to get the feel of it. Driving is really hard. Anyways that is about all I did on my birthday today. Bye!</p>

Also I hope I get to learn something with programming soon. Also I really like math because it is awesome. Math is getting harder though which is fine because I sorta like being more challenged. Language arts is the worst subject ever, and not just because I'm failing it. Anyways I've been real busy with school so i need to go now. Bye.</p>

                  <p>Ah, a new week to write my thoughts and experiences on. I'm hoping that people still frequent this blog because if not, I'd have no good reason to keep writing. Today I taught my dad how to play chess which was a fun and frustrating experience at the same time, It's always challenging to teach someone something new. Speaking of chess, I'm improving greatly at it. I finally understand the game to an extent and I can beat my friends. I like chess because it allows me to think. In my opinion, the ability to think is taken for granted. My grade in science could be better, yesterday I went from a 98% to a 90% which was due to the exam that I scored an 88% on that day, maybe next time I'll study for longer.</p>

            <p>Twelve days until my birthday, I will be turning fifteen. Today I got my grade from my math test, 100% which makes my overall math grade a 100%. Today I also took a test in science which I made an 88% on, sadly the 88% made my average in science a 90%. Math is my favorite subject and I'm really good at it this year, I also am doing very well in all other classes. I have begun the process of becoming a chess player, so far I have had several opponents at a similar skill level, and I've beat all of them. I think chess is wonderful because of the thought process that goes into playing, it works my brain and makes me feel smarter. Anyways that is all that I can think of today.</p>

I hope that I can keep my new 4.0 GPA up, I've never had good grades before and I think it would be nice to have some for the year. I have dreams of going to college and studying computer science, I wish to become either a game designer or some sort of software engineer. I wish I knew what to do with JavaScript, I believe it would be a very useful tool in the process of making websites but I don't know how to apply it. Hopefully I'm doing decent at Mathematics because there is a test coming up very, very, very soon. I plan on going away now, farewell.</p>

It has been pouring down rain all day which I love because I love rain. Today I'm gonna watch some more breaking bad and maybe play some video games because it has been a while since I gamed. Maybe some terraria. Apparently I'm really good at science which is weird because I've always been bad at science. I hope I start coding soon at school because there's not much more I can do with html and css and I don't know how to apply JavaScript that well. Anyways I think thats all for now. Goodbye.</p>

                  <p>Hello I'm not dead, I've been busy with school this week and I have a lot of up coming tests tomorrow. I plan on making a decent sized blog tommorow or maybe over the weekend. Today is just to update you on the current state of the blog, I'm not giving up on the blog yet because I can challenge my coding skills everyday and blog at the same time. See you tomorrow.</p>

                    <p>Today I woke up at like 12 pm and watched a video game documentary. I tried a new drink at chick fil a and watched some breaking bad. I haven't done much today and this blog might be shorter than the last. I have to go back to school Tuesday which is going to suck because I haven't had to go all week. After I finish writing this I'm going to be doing some JavaScript practice. The bunny has been extra cute today. Also yesterday I started making youtube videos again. Anyways I'ma go now.

That's basically all I've done today so don't expect a big ol' blog today because this will is going to be short. I think I'm going to start practicing JavaScript again because it's fun and I'm good at it. I'm having trouble finding a way to implement JavaScript into my websites though. Most of the things I do are just words and have no other function. Maybe I'll figure something out even if it's not the most practical way to do things. Anyways goodbye.</p>

            <p>Marching band practice got cancelled today which is a shame. I was planning on being able to see my friends today but nope I guess I'll have to wait for next week. I think I might try to make a new website today but I don't really have any ideas, this website has been the best idea I've had so far. I have little to talk about today so I might just go code for a little bit now. See you tomorrow.</p>

Donkey kong country got released for the snes online service and now I'm happy to own snes online, one of the few games I wanted. I have to go to band practice tomorrow which will probably be fine because I get to see my friends. I'm going to go try and code something or practice something. bye</p>

                    <p>Today I went to red lobster with my grandparents and then got some new shoes. Red lobster was really good. We went to the skechers store to get shoes and I got the most comfortable pair of tennis shoes ever. After that we went to lowes and my mom bought some flowers and it was awesome. In my car ride to red lobster my dad listened to both In the Aeroplane Over The Sea and On Avery Island. This week is going to be great because I have no school or anything, maybe I'll play more terraria. Also Diet coke is the worst drink to ever be invented, people who drink it are probably future serial killers. Anyways goodbye.</p>

                    <p>They are closing school next week, people think that there won't be any school after that. I'm being forced to go tomorrow but I don't want to, I guess it will be good to finish before the end. I have been getting really into the band neutral milk hotel lately and I think it's been all I listen to now days. My favorite song is called "Song against sex" which is a real classic, another favorite of mine is king of carrot flowers part 3. The school gets more empty everyday, barely anyone on the bus anymore which means theres more seats now but man, it's kinda sad seeing so many people gone. I've been doing cringe on my tests in digital technology because they have so little questions, I have an average of 74.5% currently which isn't failing but I really want to get a 90 in that class later on. I think the reason I'm doing so poorly on tests in that class is because they are currently about things like masters degrees and career stuff. I think it's pretty lame so far. Also it looks like I have a lot of content today compared to other days, big win. I wish I could find another project to start working on soon but I have so little knowledge about programming that I don't think I could make anything interesting; maybe i'll make a website about my hobby's and interests. This might be all that I have going on lately so I guess it's goodbye for now. Goodbye.</p>

Planning on trying out terraria hardmode today because I beat everything in my last playthrough. No one reads these blogs anymore sadly but I'm still making them for some reason, maybe I'll make a new project soon. I think I'm gonna go now. Bye everyone.</p>

                     <p>Today I feel sick so I won't be going to school tomorrow, hopefully I feel better soon. Also I think I am addicted to terraria, I have around 60 hours and I don't plan on stopping now. I feel terrible lately because of being sick though, my body feels funky and my throat hurts. I hope I can make up any work that I'm missing tomorrow. Anyways tonight is going to be a short and sweet blog due to the fact that I don't feel so great, I'm suprised that I've managed to keep it updated this long. Farewell my friends and have a great week.</p>

                     <p>Today is Friday which means the last day of the week, I actually survived the first week. Also, I have about 50 hours in terraria which means I'm a pro gamer now. I don't have much to talk about but I do know that school is nice, I enjoy going to it more so than middle school. I'm planning on whether or not I should learn how to solve a Rubik's cube again, I got really good at it and then stopped for a while. My Literature teacher has been absent for 4 days which sucks because I actually want to learn something, hopefully, he doesn't have COVID. For dinner I'm having hamburgers made by my mom, dinner will be win.</p>

           <p>Sorry for skipping yesterday's blog but I had marching band and was tired. Anyways the last two days I've been doing a lot of pre-tests but I'm not complaining. I also rode the bus for the first time today (not in my life but at this school) and it was fine. There's no marching band practice today which is great for me because I need time to update this blog and do school work. I had two substitute teachers today which was a drag because usually, that means book work, It indeed meant book work. I hope I don't get a bad grade in 9th literature because I didn't write the question down before the answer for my questions, might have to redo that before it's due just in case. Also, I haven't been able to sign into anything school-related and I don't even know my lunch number yet because I'm new in their system which sucks. I hope my technology class is what I thought it was, It's been a slow 3 days in that class but I guess it's only the 1st week. Anyways goodbye</p>

                     <p>Today I went to school. I thought high school would be scary but it isn't. Everyone expects the 9th grader to do something stupid and I only did something stupid once today. I think high school is pretty great and I'm excited to be going some more, hopefully, they don't bring it digitally again. I'm going to be learning java soon so hopefully, that will be exciting. Everyone looks so much older than me and I feel like the 6th grader again but not in a bad way. Hopefully, my classes don't become too hard. Bye.</p>

                    <p>Today I went to a new church that I didn't hate. After that, I went home and beat the final boss of pre hardmode terraria and then went to lunch with my grandparents. When I got back home we got to play with the bunny and see it hop around everywhere and it was cute. I later realized that my terraria world had been turned into hard mode. Hardmode has been giving me pains and I regret defeating the wall of flesh. Anyways tomorrow is the first day of school and I'm nervous so I'll need to go to bed soon, bye.</p>

Tomorrow is the last day of the summer. After that, I will be writing blogs about school and things related to school. Today I also played Terraria with my friends; it was fun. Haven't done much else today though so that will be it for today, hopefully, next week will be better for blogging.</p>

After that I played terraria for a while and then ate at my favorite sandwich shop, The sandwich was pretty good. To be honest I haven't been doing much today besides playing terraria, have around 29 hours in it now. Also, I have borrowed my dad's old beats wireless headphones which means music is real again. Thinking about changing the design of the website to be more modern or something because I understand that right now it looks pretty bland. Also in my computer science class, I will be learning java which may mean I will be doing less web stuff but I'm not sure what I can do with java, maybe I could make a cool Minecraft mod. Anyways goodbye and hopefully, I'll talk to you guys tomorrow.</p>

                    <p>Today I went to the farmers market with my grandma, It's her birthday and we went on an adventure. We got a ton of spicy goods and even some sweets! After that we ended up at this little restaurant that we've never been to before. Turns out the restaurant was amazing and worth a second visit, I got the burger. After that we went to a craft store and it was huge, yarn as far as the eye could see! It was a very long drive home (around 2 hours) but I'm finally here and updating this blog for you. About to eat giant pizza with my grandma for her birthday dinner. Goodbye!</p>

                    <p>Today I went to open house because my old school finally had my records ready to send and I have a schedule now. My first period is computer science which is awesome because it is also my favorite class. The last period is band which I also love and everything in between is standard school stuff. Also yesterday the bunny ate my headphone wire and I'm still really upset about that. Maybe I'll get some new headphones soon but for now, I'm stuck with only one side working. We aren't required to use a locker at my new school and I'm allowed to just use a backpack which I'm excited about. I don't understand the schools that don't let you use your backpack, why make the kid pay for something that they only use twice all day. Anyways goodbye!</p>

                    <p>Today was open house day and it was a very cringe one. When I got there they still didn't have my schedule or anything from my old school because the old school didnt actually transfer my information yet. Keep in mind that school starts monday. So i'm basically panicing because if they don't transfer the information needed before monday I won't be able to start school the first day as everyone else and will miss out on the first day of high school. Other than that though today has been pretty good. I played a lot of terraria today because that always calms me down. I have around 20 hours now and I'm not ashamed of it. Also my bunny and my dog are finally getting along which is great, I thought my dog would eat it haha! Anyways bye.</p>

                    <p>Today I went to the last day of band camp. I woke up to my dog barking at absolutely nothing and sadly it was 6:30 AM and I had to wake up at 7:00 AM. I decided to let the dog out of my room and into my sisters and tried to fall back asleep but before I knew it, it was already time to wake up. I got a small biscuit for breakfast and headed into the band room to discover the glory of the full band. Everyone was there including brass and percussion and it was a beautiful sight to see. around 8:20 AM we started stretching and sadly we had to run the spirit lap. No one was prepared for the spirt lap because we didn't have to do it last week and we had a whole weekend to not be running. After stretching we did basics block for about 30 minutes or so and then a drill-down. I got eliminated because of going from a slide into a backward march. We set drill for about 3 hours and then went inside and ate some pizza for lunch. After our pizza break, we did sectionals and practiced 4/5 pieces of music for our show. We have 3 memorized so far and we are moving onto the 4th piece of music. After that, we went into the lunchroom with everyone and did breathing exercises and played our music, and then had a 10-minute snack break. After our snack break, we went outside and played all 3 pieces of the music and color guard did their thing, and then we went home. Now, all that's left is resting.</p>

After that, I went to Micro Center because my mom had to get a new computer. She got some nice Samsung computer which I think is working well for her so far. She thought that she would hate windows (she's used mac os her entire life) but she hasn't had any trouble yet. After I helped her set that up I got on terraria for like 3 hours and played with my friend. Tomorrow is the day of marching band from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM which will probably be fine.

                    <p>Today I woke up around 8 AM and no one was awake so I just laid in bed until 9:30 AM. For breakfast, I had a gravy biscuit which I put spicy raspberry jelly on and it was great. I've been playing terraria for most of the day and I'm having a lot of fun. It's about 6:27 PM and it's thundering like crazy. I enjoy the sound of thunder but it makes my annoying sister scream. For dinner, I'm going to eat a potato pizza calzone which is the best calzone ever. I now have 10 hours in terraria and it looks like I have no life anymore. Anyways I plan on keeping this blog maintained for around 2 weeks or more especially when schools start and I become a freshman. I'm kinda nervous for high school because it will be new and not something I'm familiar with, I hate change.</p>

It's a place called soli's and I ordered a chicken salad and pimento cheese sandwich with lettuce, tomato, pickles, bell peppers, and jalapenos. After lunch, I went home and mom gave me some extra chores to do and I got 10 dollars. I was going to buy fallout new vegas with my 10 dollars but it didn't want to work so I refunded it and got Terraria which I love. It's about 10:01 PM right now and I'm getting kinda tired. Next week I have to go to band Monday which kinda sucks, I wish the band was on a Thursday or something so I could have a longer break but I'm still happy about it because its full band and we get pizza.</p>
