            <h1>August 18th</h1>
            <p>Marching band practice got cancelled today which is a shame. I was planning on being able to see my friends today but nope I guess I'll have to wait for next week. I think I might try to make a new website today but I don't really have any ideas, this website has been the best idea I've had so far. I have little to talk about today so I might just go code for a little bit now. See you tomorrow.</p>

                      <p>It appears I'm going to be doing my blog every other day now. I've been trying to learn java lately because I've been bored but idk how far I will get in it. Donkey kong country got released for the snes online service and now I'm happy to own snes online, one of the few games I wanted. I have to go to band practice tomorrow which will probably be fine because I get to see my friends. I'm going to go try and code something or practice something. bye</p>

                    <p>Today I went to red lobster with my grandparents and then got some new shoes. Red lobster was really good. We went to the skechers store to get shoes and I got the most comfortable pair of tennis shoes ever. After that we went to lowes and my mom bought some flowers and it was awesome. In my car ride to red lobster my dad listened to both In the Aeroplane Over The Sea and On Avery Island. This week is going to be great because I have no school or anything, maybe I'll play more terraria. Also Diet coke is the worst drink to ever be invented, people who drink it are probably future serial killers. Anyways goodbye.</p>

                    <h1>August 13th</h1>
                    <p>They are closing school next week, people think that there won't be any school after that. I'm being forced to go tomorrow but I don't want to, I guess it will be good to finish before the end. I have been getting really into the band neutral milk hotel lately and I think it's been all I listen to now days. My favorite song is called "Song against sex" which is a real classic, another favorite of mine is king of carrot flowers part 3. The school gets more empty everyday, barely anyone on the bus anymore which means theres more seats now but man, it's kinda sad seeing so many people gone. I've been doing cringe on my tests in digital technology because they have so little questions, I have an average of 74.5% currently which isn't failing but I really want to get a 90 in that class later on. I think the reason I'm doing so poorly on tests in that class is because they are currently about things like masters degrees and career stuff. I think it's pretty lame so far. Also it looks like I have a lot of content today compared to other days, big win. I wish I could find another project to start working on soon but I have so little knowledge about programming that I don't think I could make anything interesting; maybe i'll make a website about my hobby's and interests. This might be all that I have going on lately so I guess it's goodbye for now. Goodbye.</p>

                     <p>Today Was my first day back to school since being sick, it went decent. I finished all my work at school and did everything that I missed yesterday. Planning on trying out terraria hardmode today because I beat everything in my last playthrough. No one reads these blogs anymore sadly but I'm still making them for some reason, maybe I'll make a new project soon. I think I'm gonna go now. Bye everyone.</p>

                     <p>Today I feel sick so I won't be going to school tomorrow, hopefully I feel better soon. Also I think I am addicted to terraria, I have around 60 hours and I don't plan on stopping now. I feel terrible lately because of being sick though, my body feels funky and my throat hurts. I hope I can make up any work that I'm missing tomorrow. Anyways tonight is going to be a short and sweet blog due to the fact that I don't feel so great, I'm suprised that I've managed to keep it updated this long. Farewell my friends and have a great week.</p>

                     <p>Today is Friday which means the last day of the week, I actually survived the first week. Also, I have about 50 hours in terraria which means I'm a pro gamer now. I don't have much to talk about but I do know that school is nice, I enjoy going to it more so than middle school. I'm planning on whether or not I should learn how to solve a Rubik's cube again, I got really good at it and then stopped for a while. My Literature teacher has been absent for 4 days which sucks because I actually want to learn something, hopefully, he doesn't have COVID. For dinner I'm having hamburgers made by my mom, dinner will be win.</p>

           <h1>August 5th</h1>
           <p>Sorry for skipping yesterday's blog but I had marching band and was tired. Anyways the last two days I've been doing a lot of pre-tests but I'm not complaining. I also rode the bus for the first time today (not in my life but at this school) and it was fine. There's no marching band practice today which is great for me because I need time to update this blog and do school work. I had two substitute teachers today which was a drag because usually, that means book work, It indeed meant book work. I hope I don't get a bad grade in 9th literature because I didn't write the question down before the answer for my questions, might have to redo that before it's due just in case. Also, I haven't been able to sign into anything school-related and I don't even know my lunch number yet because I'm new in their system which sucks. I hope my technology class is what I thought it was, It's been a slow 3 days in that class but I guess it's only the 1st week. Anyways goodbye</p>

                     <p>Today I went to school. I thought high school would be scary but it isn't. Everyone expects the 9th grader to do something stupid and I only did something stupid once today. I think high school is pretty great and I'm excited to be going some more, hopefully, they don't bring it digitally again. I'm going to be learning java soon so hopefully, that will be exciting. Everyone looks so much older than me and I feel like the 6th grader again but not in a bad way. Hopefully, my classes don't become too hard. Bye.</p>

                    <p>Today I went to a new church that I didn't hate. After that, I went home and beat the final boss of pre hardmode terraria and then went to lunch with my grandparents. When I got back home we got to play with the bunny and see it hop around everywhere and it was cute. I later realized that my terraria world had been turned into hard mode. Hardmode has been giving me pains and I regret defeating the wall of flesh. Anyways tomorrow is the first day of school and I'm nervous so I'll need to go to bed soon, bye.</p>

                    <p>Today I woke up and then it was time to go to lunch, we ate red lobster. I rarely go to red lobster (around once every two years or more) it was cool to be able to go. Tomorrow is the last day of the summer. After that, I will be writing blogs about school and things related to school. Today I also played Terraria with my friends; it was fun. Haven't done much else today though so that will be it for today, hopefully, next week will be better for blogging.</p>

                    <p>Today I woke up and then went right back to bed until about 1 pm. After that I played terraria for a while and then ate at my favorite sandwich shop, The sandwich was pretty good. To be honest I haven't been doing much today besides playing terraria, have around 29 hours in it now. Also, I have borrowed my dad's old beats wireless headphones which means music is real again. Thinking about changing the design of the website to be more modern or something because I understand that right now it looks pretty bland. Also in my computer science class, I will be learning java which may mean I will be doing less web stuff but I'm not sure what I can do with java, maybe I could make a cool Minecraft mod. Anyways goodbye and hopefully, I'll talk to you guys tomorrow.</p>

                    <p>Today I went to the farmers market with my grandma, It's her birthday and we went on an adventure. We got a ton of spicy goods and even some sweets! After that we ended up at this little restaurant that we've never been to before. Turns out the restaurant was amazing and worth a second visit, I got the burger. After that we went to a craft store and it was huge, yarn as far as the eye could see! It was a very long drive home (around 2 hours) but I'm finally here and updating this blog for you. About to eat giant pizza with my grandma for her birthday dinner. Goodbye!</p>

                    <p>Today I went to open house because my old school finally had my records ready to send and I have a schedule now. My first period is computer science which is awesome because it is also my favorite class. The last period is band which I also love and everything in between is standard school stuff. Also yesterday the bunny ate my headphone wire and I'm still really upset about that. Maybe I'll get some new headphones soon but for now, I'm stuck with only one side working. We aren't required to use a locker at my new school and I'm allowed to just use a backpack which I'm excited about. I don't understand the schools that don't let you use your backpack, why make the kid pay for something that they only use twice all day. Anyways goodbye!</p>

                    <h1>July 28th</h1>
                    <p>Today was open house day and it was a very cringe one. When I got there they still didn't have my schedule or anything from my old school because the old school didnt actually transfer my information yet. Keep in mind that school starts monday. So i'm basically panicing because if they don't transfer the information needed before monday I won't be able to start school the first day as everyone else and will miss out on the first day of high school. Other than that though today has been pretty good. I played a lot of terraria today because that always calms me down. I have around 20 hours now and I'm not ashamed of it. Also my bunny and my dog are finally getting along which is great, I thought my dog would eat it haha! Anyways bye.</p>

                    <h1>July 27th</h1>
                    <p>Today I went to the last day of band camp. I woke up to my dog barking at absolutely nothing and sadly it was 6:30 AM and I had to wake up at 7:00 AM. I decided to let the dog out of my room and into my sisters and tried to fall back asleep but before I knew it, it was already time to wake up. I got a small biscuit for breakfast and headed into the band room to discover the glory of the full band. Everyone was there including brass and percussion and it was a beautiful sight to see. around 8:20 AM we started stretching and sadly we had to run the spirit lap. No one was prepared for the spirt lap because we didn't have to do it last week and we had a whole weekend to not be running. After stretching we did basics block for about 30 minutes or so and then a drill-down. I got eliminated because of going from a slide into a backward march. We set drill for about 3 hours and then went inside and ate some pizza for lunch. After our pizza break, we did sectionals and practiced 4/5 pieces of music for our show. We have 3 memorized so far and we are moving onto the 4th piece of music. After that, we went into the lunchroom with everyone and did breathing exercises and played our music, and then had a 10-minute snack break. After our snack break, we went outside and played all 3 pieces of the music and color guard did their thing, and then we went home. Now, all that's left is resting.</p>

                    <p>Today I went to a great restaurant with my grandparents. I got eggs benedict and it was great and they also got my drink order correct (most restaurants mess it up). After that, I went to Micro Center because my mom had to get a new computer. She got some nice Samsung computer which I think is working well for her so far. She thought that she would hate windows (she's used mac os her entire life) but she hasn't had any trouble yet. After I helped her set that up I got on terraria for like 3 hours and played with my friend. Tomorrow is the day of marching band from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM which will probably be fine. Anyways, bye.</p>

                    <p>Today I woke up around 8 AM and no one was awake so I just laid in bed until 9:30 AM. For breakfast, I had a gravy biscuit which I put spicy raspberry jelly on and it was great. I've been playing terraria for most of the day and I'm having a lot of fun. It's about 6:27 PM and it's thundering like crazy. I enjoy the sound of thunder but it makes my annoying sister scream. For dinner, I'm going to eat a potato pizza calzone which is the best calzone ever. I now have 10 hours in terraria and it looks like I have no life anymore. Anyways I plan on keeping this blog maintained for around 2 weeks or more especially when schools start and I become a freshman. I'm kinda nervous for high school because it will be new and not something I'm familiar with, I hate change.</p>

                    <p>Today I got to eat at my favorite sandwich shop for lunch. It's a place called soli's and I ordered a chicken salad and pimento cheese sandwich with lettuce, tomato, pickles, bell peppers, and jalapenos. After lunch, I went home and mom gave me some extra chores to do and I got 10 dollars. I was going to buy fallout new vegas with my 10 dollars but it didn't want to work so I refunded it and got Terraria which I love. It's about 10:01 PM right now and I'm getting kinda tired. Next week I have to go to band Monday which kinda sucks, I wish the band was on a Thursday or something so I could have a longer break but I'm still happy about it because its full band and we get pizza.</p>

Next week I have to go to practice on Monday from 8 AM to 5 PM which will be cringe but at least there's no more practice for the rest of that week. Also, I get tomorrow off (Three day weekend!).

I wish marching band camp could last longer or at least the full 10 hours each day instead of the 4 hours I'm stuck with because of COVID. Also, I chipped my tooth on a lifesavers mint today so that sucks, I was just trying to keep da stank away.</p>
