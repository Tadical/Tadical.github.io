           <h1>August 5th</h1>
           <p>Sorry for skipping yesterday's blog but I had marching band and was tired. Anyways the last two days I've been doing a lot of pre-tests but I'm not complaining. I also rode the bus for the first time today (not in my life but at this school) and it was fine. There's no marching band practice today which is great for me because I need time to update this blog and do school work. I had two substitute teachers today which was a drag because usually, that means book work, It indeed meant book work. I hope I don't get a bad grade in 9th literature because I didn't write the question down before the answer for my questions, might have to redo that before it's due just in case. Also, I haven't been able to sign into anything school-related and I don't even know my lunch number yet because I'm new in their system which sucks. I hope my technology class is what I thought it was, It's been a slow 3 days in that class but I guess it's only the 1st week. Anyways goodbye</p>

                     <h1>August 3rd</h1>
                     <p>Today I went to school. I thought high school would be scary but it isn't. Everyone expects the 9th grader to do something stupid and I only did something stupid once today. I think high school is pretty great and I'm excited to be going some more, hopefully, they don't bring it digitally again. I'm going to be learning java soon so hopefully, that will be exciting. Everyone looks so much older than me and I feel like the 6th grader again but not in a bad way. Hopefully, my classes don't become too hard. Bye.</p>

                    <h1>August 2nd</h1>
                    <p>Today I went to a new church that I didn't hate. After that, I went home and beat the final boss of pre hardmode terraria and then went to lunch with my grandparents. When I got back home we got to play with the bunny and see it hop around everywhere and it was cute. I later realized that my terraria world had been turned into hard mode. Hardmode has been giving me pains and I regret defeating the wall of flesh. Anyways tomorrow is the first day of school and I'm nervous so I'll need to go to bed soon, bye.</p>

                    <h1>August 1st</h1>
                    <p>Today I woke up and then it was time to go to lunch, we ate red lobster. I rarely go to red lobster (around once every two years or more) it was cool to be able to go. Tomorrow is the last day of the summer. After that, I will be writing blogs about school and things related to school. Today I also played Terraria with my friends; it was fun. Haven't done much else today though so that will be it for today, hopefully, next week will be better for blogging.</p>

                    <h1>July 31st</h1>
                    <p>Today I woke up and then went right back to bed until about 1 pm. After that I played terraria for a while and then ate at my favorite sandwich shop, The sandwich was pretty good. To be honest I haven't been doing much today besides playing terraria, have around 29 hours in it now. Also, I have borrowed my dad's old beats wireless headphones which means music is real again. Thinking about changing the design of the website to be more modern or something because I understand that right now it looks pretty bland. Also in my computer science class, I will be learning java which may mean I will be doing less web stuff but I'm not sure what I can do with java, maybe I could make a cool Minecraft mod. Anyways goodbye and hopefully, I'll talk to you guys tomorrow.</p>

                    <h1>July 30th</h1>
                    <p>Today I went to the farmers market with my grandma, It's her birthday and we went on an adventure. We got a ton of spicy goods and even some sweets! After that we ended up at this little restaurant that we've never been to before. Turns out the restaurant was amazing and worth a second visit, I got the burger. After that we went to a craft store and it was huge, yarn as far as the eye could see! It was a very long drive home (around 2 hours) but I'm finally here and updating this blog for you. About to eat giant pizza with my grandma for her birthday dinner. Goodbye!</p>

                    <h1>July 29th</h1>
                    <p>Today I went to open house because my old school finally had my records ready to send and I have a schedule now. My first period is computer science which is awesome because it is also my favorite class. The last period is band which I also love and everything in between is standard school stuff. Also yesterday the bunny ate my headphone wire and I'm still really upset about that. Maybe I'll get some new headphones soon but for now, I'm stuck with only one side working. We aren't required to use a locker at my new school and I'm allowed to just use a backpack which I'm excited about. I don't understand the schools that don't let you use your backpack, why make the kid pay for something that they only use twice all day. Anyways goodbye!</p>

                    <h1>July 28th</h1>
                    <p>Today was open house day and it was a very cringe one. When I got there they still didn't have my schedule or anything from my old school because the old school didnt actually transfer my information yet. Keep in mind that school starts monday. So i'm basically panicing because if they don't transfer the information needed before monday I won't be able to start school the first day as everyone else and will miss out on the first day of high school. Other than that though today has been pretty good. I played a lot of terraria today because that always calms me down. I have around 20 hours now and I'm not ashamed of it. Also my bunny and my dog are finally getting along which is great, I thought my dog would eat it haha! Anyways bye.</p>

                    <h1>July 27th</h1>
                    <p>Today I went to the last day of band camp. I woke up to my dog barking at absolutely nothing and sadly it was 6:30 AM and I had to wake up at 7:00 AM. I decided to let the dog out of my room and into my sisters and tried to fall back asleep but before I knew it, it was already time to wake up. I got a small biscuit for breakfast and headed into the band room to discover the glory of the full band. Everyone was there including brass and percussion and it was a beautiful sight to see. around 8:20 AM we started stretching and sadly we had to run the spirit lap. No one was prepared for the spirt lap because we didn't have to do it last week and we had a whole weekend to not be running. After stretching we did basics block for about 30 minutes or so and then a drill-down. I got eliminated because of going from a slide into a backward march. We set drill for about 3 hours and then went inside and ate some pizza for lunch. After our pizza break, we did sectionals and practiced 4/5 pieces of music for our show. We have 3 memorized so far and we are moving onto the 4th piece of music. After that, we went into the lunchroom with everyone and did breathing exercises and played our music, and then had a 10-minute snack break. After our snack break, we went outside and played all 3 pieces of the music and color guard did their thing, and then we went home. Now, all that's left is resting.</p>

                    <p>Today I went to a great restaurant with my grandparents. I got eggs benedict and it was great and they also got my drink order correct (most restaurants mess it up). After that, I went to Micro Center because my mom had to get a new computer. She got some nice Samsung computer which I think is working well for her so far. She thought that she would hate windows (she's used mac os her entire life) but she hasn't had any trouble yet. After I helped her set that up I got on terraria for like 3 hours and played with my friend. Tomorrow is the day of marching band from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM which will probably be fine. Anyways, bye.</p>

                    <p>Today I woke up around 8 AM and no one was awake so I just laid in bed until 9:30 AM. For breakfast, I had a gravy biscuit which I put spicy raspberry jelly on and it was great. I've been playing terraria for most of the day and I'm having a lot of fun. It's about 6:27 PM and it's thundering like crazy. I enjoy the sound of thunder but it makes my annoying sister scream. For dinner, I'm going to eat a potato pizza calzone which is the best calzone ever. I now have 10 hours in terraria and it looks like I have no life anymore. Anyways I plan on keeping this blog maintained for around 2 weeks or more especially when schools start and I become a freshman. I'm kinda nervous for high school because it will be new and not something I'm familiar with, I hate change.</p>

                    <p>Today I got to eat at my favorite sandwich shop for lunch. It's a place called soli's and I ordered a chicken salad and pimento cheese sandwich with lettuce, tomato, pickles, bell peppers, and jalapenos. After lunch, I went home and mom gave me some extra chores to do and I got 10 dollars. I was going to buy fallout new vegas with my 10 dollars but it didn't want to work so I refunded it and got Terraria which I love. It's about 10:01 PM right now and I'm getting kinda tired. Next week I have to go to band Monday which kinda sucks, I wish the band was on a Thursday or something so I could have a longer break but I'm still happy about it because its full band and we get pizza.</p>

                    <p>Today was the last day of band camp and I'm extremely tired. Next week I have to go to practice on Monday from 8 AM to 5 PM which will be cringe but at least there's no more practice for the rest of that week. Also, I get tomorrow off (Three day weekend!). Also, my Tooth feels better today and I can just sit in my bed and relax.</p>

                     <p>Today is the second to last day of marching band camp, I'm kind of sad about it. I wish marching band camp could last longer or at least the full 10 hours each day instead of the 4 hours I'm stuck with because of COVID. Also, I chipped my tooth on a lifesavers mint today so that sucks, I was just trying to keep da stank away.</p>
